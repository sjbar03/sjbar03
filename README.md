Hi, I'm Stephen Barlett.

I'm a junior CS major at Cornell. I am interested in electrical engineering and computer architecture.

I'm currently building a study application for my girlfriend, who is in pharmacy school. Some of my other projects include retro game clones and financial trading applications.
