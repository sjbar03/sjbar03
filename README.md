Hi, I'm Stephen Barlett.

I'm a junior CS major at Cornell. I am interested in electrical engineering and computer architecture.

🔧Functional Programming -> OCaml🐫
🧠OOP -> Python, Java☕, C++⌨️

💡Vim enthusiast💡

I'm currently building a study application for my girlfriend, who is in pharmacy school. The application can be used to prescribe medications to randomly generated patients with real conditions. Utilizing the OpenFDA Drug endpoint (https://github.com/FDA/openfda) the application is also capable of creating treatment plans for these patients **automatically**. Check it out in my PillPal repo💊 (https://github.com/sjbar03/PillPal).

Some of my other projects include retro game clones🐍 and financial trading applications💸.
